## Hello!
I'm a M.S. Student in the Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST, advised by Prof. Joyce Jiyoung Whang at the Big Data Intelligence Lab ([**BDI Lab**](https://bdi-lab.kaist.ac.kr)).
I have attached my CV in the **CV** section and organized the projects I have undertaken since my undergraduate studies in the **Portfolio** section.  
Clicking on each card will provide detailed descriptions, along with the corresponding PDF reports and presentation slides.

Recently, I have developed a strong interest in **Multimodal Machine Learning**, **Time-Series Data Analysis**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)**.  
My focus lies in extracting meaningful insights from the diverse formats of data that are inevitably accumulated across the increasingly digitalized domains of business.  
I am particularly motivated by the potential of these approaches to enhance AI models’ ability to understand and learn from complex sociocultural phenomena.

Thank you for visiting.
