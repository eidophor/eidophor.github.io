## Hello!
I'm a M.S. Student in the Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST, advised by Prof. Joyce Jiyoung Whang at the Big Data Intelligence Lab ([**BDI Lab**](https://bdi-lab.kaist.ac.kr)).

Recently, I have developed a strong interest in **Multimodal Machine Learning**, **Graph Machine Learning**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)**.  
My focus lies in extracting meaningful insights from the diverse formats of data that are inevitably accumulated across the increasingly digitalized domains of business.  
I am particularly motivated by the potential of these approaches to enhance AI models’ ability to understand and learn from complex sociocultural phenomena.

Thank you for visiting.
